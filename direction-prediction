# Generated the columns: log returns, simple moving average with window size = 7, momentum(window = 7), volatility, direction. 

# Calculate log returns
df['log_returns'] = calculate_log_returns(df['Close'])

# Calculate simple moving average with a window of 7 days
df['sma'] = calculate_simple_moving_average(df['Close'], window=7)

# Calculate momentum with a window of 7 days
df['momentum'] = calculate_momentum(df['Close'], window=7)

# Calculate volatility with a window of 7 days
df['volatility'] = calculate_volatility(df['Close'], window=7)

# Calculate direction
df['direction'] = calculate_direction(df['Close'])

# Goal 1: Trying to predict if the closing value next day would be grater than or smaller than the current value.
